# General Code Review Template

This template provides comprehensive guidelines for general code reviews using Claude Code Review Action.

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Code Quality & Maintainability
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Functions and classes have single responsibilities
- [ ] Code is readable and well-structured
- [ ] Complex logic is properly commented
- [ ] Magic numbers and strings are avoided

### 2. Best Practices & Standards
- [ ] Naming conventions are consistent and descriptive
- [ ] Code follows language-specific best practices
- [ ] Dependencies are properly managed
- [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] SOLID principles are applied where appropriate

### 3. Error Handling & Robustness
- [ ] Proper error handling is implemented
- [ ] Edge cases are considered and handled
- [ ] Input validation is performed where necessary
- [ ] Graceful degradation is implemented
- [ ] Logging is appropriate and informative

### 4. Performance Considerations
- [ ] No obvious performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Efficient algorithms and data structures
- [ ] Resource usage is optimized
- [ ] Database queries are efficient
- [ ] Memory leaks are avoided

### 5. Security Awareness
- [ ] No sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Input sanitization is performed
- [ ] Authentication/authorization is proper
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date

### 6. Testing & Documentation
