## Performance Metrics & Benchmarks

### Time Complexity Guidelines
- **O(1)** - Constant time ‚úÖ
- **O(log n)** - Logarithmic time ‚úÖ
- **O(n)** - Linear time ‚ö†Ô∏è (acceptable for most cases)
- **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic time ‚ö†Ô∏è (sorting algorithms)
- **O(n¬≤)** - Quadratic time üî¥ (avoid when possible)
- **O(2‚Åø)** - Exponential time üî¥ (avoid)

### Database Query Guidelines
- **< 100ms** - Excellent ‚úÖ
- **100-500ms** - Good ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **500ms-1s** - Acceptable for complex queries ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **> 1s** - Needs optimization üî¥

### Memory Usage Guidelines
- Monitor heap usage and garbage collection
- Avoid memory leaks in long-running processes
- Use appropriate data structures for memory efficiency
- Consider memory vs. CPU trade-offs

## Performance Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Database Anti-Patterns
```sql
-- ‚ùå Bad: N+1 Query Problem
SELECT * FROM orders;
-- Then for each order:
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = ?;

-- ‚úÖ Good: Join Query
SELECT o.*, c.* 
FROM orders o 
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```

### Algorithm Anti-Patterns
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad: Nested loops for search
function findCommon(arr1, arr2) {
    const common = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            if (arr1[i] === arr2[j]) {
                common.push(arr1[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    return common;
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Using Set for O(1) lookups
function findCommon(arr1, arr2) {
    const set = new Set(arr2);
    return arr1.filter(item => set.has(item));
}
```

### Memory Anti-Patterns
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Loading all data into memory
def process_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()  # Loads entire file
    return process_data(data)

# ‚úÖ Good: Streaming/chunked processing
def process_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:  # Process line by line
            yield process_line(line)
```

## Performance Review Severity Guidelines

### Critical üî¥
- Exponential time complexity
- Memory leaks in production code
- Blocking operations in critical paths
- Infinite loops or recursion
- Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities

### High üü°
- Quadratic time complexity in frequently called code
- Unoptimized database queries
- Large objects loaded unnecessarily
- Missing indexes on frequent queries
- Inefficient API usage patterns

### Medium üü†
- Suboptimal algorithm choices
- Missing caching opportunities
- Inefficient data structure usage
- Unnecessary object creation
- Non-critical performance improvements

### Low üü¢
- Minor optimization opportunities
- Code style that could be more efficient
- Potential future performance considerations
- Documentation for performance-critical sections

## Performance Testing Recommendations

### Load Testing
```yaml
# Example load testing configuration
- name: Performance Test
  run: |
    # Use tools like k6, JMeter, or Artillery
    k6 run --vus 100 --duration 30s performance-test.js
```

### Profiling
```bash
# Example profiling commands
node --prof app.js                    # Node.js profiling
python -m cProfile -o profile.prof    # Python profiling
go tool pprof cpu.prof                # Go profiling
```

### Monitoring
- Set up application performance monitoring (APM)
- Track key metrics (response time, throughput, error rate)
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- Set up alerting for performance degradation
